# Smart_Face_Surveillance_Camera

This is my Final Year Project during my last year at Unikl MIAT. 

# Problem Statement

the cases of the aircraft accident/ hijack are being familiar in the aviation industry. Face recognition is the 
best algorithm that can be developed to help increase the security system. However, most of the time when the accident 
happened the authority cannot track or trace the face of the passenger in the aircraft due to some limitation . 
The authority will check the CCTV footage at the airport which will take a long time for recognition. This process should 
be more efficient to detect any possibility that would happen next. Thus, with this smart and intelligent face tracking 
system and passenger attendance, this process will be adequate to solve the security issue.



# Objective 

The objective of this project are :

-To develop the system with the intelligent smart face tracking system and recognition of the passenger details
-To create the algorithm system that stores and tracks passenger data using Cloud
-To test a face recognition system with the passenger attendance system

# Scope of Study

This project is developed to focus on the passenger and aircrew face track attendance. The current technology uses 
Raspberry pi to recognize the face and the passengerâ€™s details by following the flight check in ticket. This method
used to ensure the tightest safety of all the passengers and aircrew in the aircraft is implemented. Most of the issues 
is, the authority cannot define who entered the aircraft when the accident happened because they do not have exact figures 
or data. The development of early smart face tracking algorithms with the attendance recognition are to detect the 
appearance of suspicious passengers and aircrew on board which can cause a problem to the safety of the country . This 
project aims to improve the airport and airline security thus establishing a secure environment
